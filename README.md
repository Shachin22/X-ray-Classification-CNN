# X-ray-Classification-CNN
Creating a CNN to classify between Covid, Pneumonia and healthy X-rays

## Notebook Structure

### Data Exploration

Initially exploring the images to find any issues that may cause problems when creating the ML model. Some of the main issues identified was the imbalanced dataset and problems with the images such as low contrast and poorly zoomed images.

### Data Preprocessing

This section covers how the problems were resolved e.g using histogram equilization to fix poor contrast. Also using data augmentation to help with the imbalance in the dataset

### Initial CNN Model Architecture

Creating a base model to provide inital results to then apply improvements on

### Experiments + Final Model

Showing the hyperparameters that were focuused on and the final CNN model that was used


### Results
Testing the model with and without data augmentation

Finally displaying the results using a confusion matrix
